# Cloud Architecture - Order Management System

## 1. Architecture and Main Components

I've chosen **AWS** as the cloud platform because it's widely used and has good documentation. The system will be deployed using a simple microservices approach with three main parts:

### **Main Components:**

**Frontend (React App):**

- **AWS EC2**: Virtual server to run the React application
- **AWS S3**: Storage for static files (images, CSS, JS)
- **AWS CloudFront**: CDN to make the app load faster globally
- **AWS Route 53**: DNS management for custom domain

**.NET 8 API:**

- **AWS EC2**: Virtual server to run the .NET API
- **AWS RDS**: Managed database (PostgreSQL) for products and categories
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy and load balancer

**Node.js Backend:**

- **AWS EC2**: Virtual server to run the Node.js app
- **AWS DocumentDB**: MongoDB-compatible database for storing orders
- **PM2**: Process manager to keep Node.js running
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy and load balancer

**Basic AWS Services:**

- **AWS IAM**: User and permission management
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Basic monitoring and logging
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Free SSL certificates
- **AWS Application Load Balancer**: SSL termination and traffic distribution

## 3. Component Roles and Responsibilities

### **Frontend (React Application)**

**Role:** The React app that users interact with to browse products and place orders

**What it does:**

- Shows product catalog from the .NET API
- Handles user input for orders
- Sends order data to Node.js backend

**Automation:**

- Auto-scaling: If the server gets too busy, AWS will start more instances
- Basic health checks: AWS checks if the server is responding

**Monitoring:**

- CloudWatch logs: Basic application logs
- Simple metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, response times

**Security:**

- HTTPS: All traffic is encrypted (SSL from AWS Certificate Manager)
- Security groups: Basic firewall rules
- IAM roles: Limited permissions for the server

**Configuration:**

- Environment variables: API endpoints and settings
- S3 for static files: Images and CSS files
- NGINX configuration: Reverse proxy settings

### **.NET 8 API**

**Role:** Provides product and category data to the frontend

**What it does:**

- Serves product information from PostgreSQL database
- Handles category data
- Provides REST API endpoints

**Automation:**

- Database backups: AWS automatically backs up the database daily
- Auto-scaling: More instances if traffic increases

**Monitoring:**

- API response times
- Database connection status
- Error logs in CloudWatch
- Built-in .NET logging framework

**Security:**

- Database encryption: Data is encrypted at rest
- Network security: Only allows connections from the load balancer
- IAM authentication: Secure database access
- SSL termination at load balancer

**Configuration:**

- Database connection string from environment variables
- API settings and CORS configuration
- NGINX reverse proxy configuration

### **Node.js Backend**

## Summary

This architecture provides:

- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling handles traffic spikes
- **Reliability**: Multiple servers, PM2 process management, and automated backups
- **Security**: SSL encryption, basic firewall rules, and access controls
- **Monitoring**: Simple logging (Winston, .NET logging, PM2) and alerting
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Professional**: Custom domain with SSL certificate

The system maintains the original functionality (React frontend, .NET API for products, Node.js for orders with MongoDB) while using AWS managed services and standard production tools for better reliability and easier maintenance.
